Professor bash is a project im working to add AI to the bash command line. All I do is type 

Ask then enter my question or describe code I want generated 

and all my bash script questions are answered or the code is automatically generated and run for me, it's my version of an updated help or man for bash. 

I'm going to update the code so that it includes popular programming languages and can help anyone write programs and learn to write any type of script they need with the help of AI and never leave the command line, run the code and debug the code. 

I'm going to add some more features like automatically check what error codes mean and how to debug the code using AI, get suggestions to improve code and how to clean up code to make it easier to read
